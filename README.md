NELL (Never-Ending Language Learning) a supercomputer continuously reading webpages everyday 24hrs, since its inception in 2010. A project funded by DARPA, Google and Other giants. The goal is to understand reading information in structured form from unstructured format data organised throughout the WEB. 

#### What have I done?

I have made a few lists of projects, through the NELL dataset. Because I take NELL, as a fundamental dataset and framework for both better performing search, reading, semantic search, machine learning and natural language processing. 

To make things simple and informative, I have chosen, below projects:

1. Semantic Search
2. Knowledge Graph
3. Corpus creation
4. Sentiment Analysis

#### What tools are used? 

To ease the pain of loading a large dataset, I have used Apache Spark (Better than Pandas). 

#### How are operations performed?

Operations are limited to the first 50 rows.
